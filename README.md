# Pymaceuticals — Tumor Response Analysis (Preclinical Study)

> A clean, reproducible pandas/matplotlib study of tumor volume changes across multiple drug regimens in mice, using `Mouse_metadata.csv` and `Study_results.csv`.

## Summary
This project analyzes longitudinal tumor measurements from a controlled mouse study. We merge subject metadata with time-series tumor readings, clean duplicates/anomalies, and compare efficacy and variability across regimens. The analysis highlights which drugs reduce tumor volume most consistently, where variability/outliers occur, and how tumor size relates to body weight for a representative treatment.

## Goal
- **Primary:** Quantify and compare treatment efficacy and stability across regimens.
- **Secondary:** Build refreshable summary tables and figures to support preclinical decisions (e.g., regimen selection, follow-up design).

## Procedure
1. **Data Prep**
   - Load `Mouse_metadata.csv` and `Study_results.csv`.
   - Merge on `Mouse ID`; de-duplicate inconsistent timepoints; type/NA checks.
2. **Cohort Overview**
   - Count unique mice per regimen; gender distribution.
   - Summary stats per regimen (mean, median, variance, std, SEM of tumor volume).
3. **Efficacy & Variability**
   - For four focus regimens (e.g., Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin), compute **final tumor volume** per mouse at the last timepoint.
   - Detect **outliers** via IQR; visualize with a **box plot** across regimens.
4. **Time Series & Correlates**
   - Pick one mouse on a focal drug and plot **tumor volume over time** (line chart).
   - For the focal drug (e.g., Capomulin), compute **avg tumor volume vs. mouse weight**; produce a **scatter plot** and **linear regression** with R².
5. **Presentation**
   - Bar chart: mice per regimen.
   - Pie chart: gender split.
   - Tables and figures exported with consistent formatting.

## Results
- **Cohort:** Balanced counts across most regimens; clear gender representation.
- **Efficacy signals:** Two regimens (commonly Capomulin/Ramicane) show **lower final tumor volumes and tighter dispersion**, indicating stronger and more consistent responses.
- **Risk flags:** Certain regimens (e.g., Infubinol/Ceftamin) exhibit **higher variance** and **notable outliers**, suggesting heterogeneous response.
- **Mechanistic hint:** For the focal drug, **tumor volume correlates positively with mouse weight**; regression line and R² quantify the relationship.
> Exact values/plots are generated by the notebook; re-run to refresh with current data.

## Business Impact
- **Portfolio focus:** Prioritize regimens with strong median reduction and low variability for next-stage studies.
- **Trial design:** Use dispersion and outlier rates to inform **sample size/power** and **stratification** (e.g., by weight).
- **Risk management:** Early identification of volatile regimens saves downstream cost/time in non-responsive cohorts.

## Next Step to Make It Better
- **Statistics:** Mixed-effects models for repeated measures; ANCOVA controlling for weight; survival/endpoint analysis.
- **Robustness:** Sensitivity checks (alt. outlier rules), bootstrapped CIs, per-site variability if metadata available.
- **Biology:** Dose-response curves; exposure–response (PK/PD) if concentrations are available.
- **Data Quality:** Automated QC (Great Expectations), duplicate/timepoint audits, preregistered analysis plan.
- **Reproducibility:** Parameterize notebook, add tests and CI; export a lightweight dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly).
